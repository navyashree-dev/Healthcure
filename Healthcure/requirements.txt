ARCGIS

 is that it understands location.
It's like a super-smart mapping tool: Instead of just looking at a flat picture of a map, ArcGIS lets you see and interact with all sorts of information that's "on" or "related to" that map. This could be anything from roads, rivers, and buildings to population density, crime rates, or even where all the coffee shops are.
Where are the areas with the highest risk of flooding?"
"What's the shortest route between two points?"
"Where should we open a new store to reach the most customers?"
"How has the forest cover changed in this region over the last 20 years?" ArcGIS provides tools to analyze and visualize data to answer these kinds of questions.
